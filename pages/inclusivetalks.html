<h2>Tips for Creating Inclusive Talks and Videos</h2>
<p>This article explains some additional tips on inclusive practices when creating slide 
  content for talks, as well as during speaking and recording videos. Also check out this 
  previous article on <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting.html">inclusive writing</a>.


  <h3>Slide content</h3>
<p>It helps improve readability if your font sizes are not too small and if you avoid packing too 
  much content onto one slide. If possible, avoid embedding text into images if similarly effective 
  alternatives exist for rendering your content. Images in slides are usually unreadable for screen 
  readers, which are often used by people with visual impairments.

  <h3>During speaking/recording videos</h3>
    <p>It helps improve legibility if you pause for a moment in between sections and also during slide 
      transitions. If possible, avoid speaking too fast, since that can make comprehension harder for 
      many non-native English speakers, as well as people with hearing impairments. If you plan to 
      record your face while speaking, look directly at the camera while speaking so that lipreading 
      is more feasible for people with hearing impairments.

  <h3>Transcripts and captioning</h3>
  <p>Consider inviting all authors to contribute recorded talk videos to contribute plaintext transcripts 
    of their talk and also embed time-aligned captions/subtitles in their videos. 
    Captions are widely known to be helpful in enabling better comprehension for people with auditory 
    impairments and non-native English speakers. [1] Captions also help many people who find different 
    accents more difficult to comprehend.

  <p>To create a plaintext transcript, you could write down what you speak ab initio. Alternatively, 
  you could use a (free) automatic speech recognition (ASR) service to convert your recorded audio to an 
    intermediate text file that you can then edit to correct ASR errors.

   <p>To create closed captioning for video, here is a suggested and hopefully easy-to-execute workflow
      based on Youtube's capabilities [2]:

  <ul>
  <li>Record your video as usual, say, with Zoom. Obtain an MP4 file.
  <li>Use Youtube (or a similar service, e.g., https://jianwai.youdao.com) to upload the video and 
    obtain its closed captions as a timestamped transcript file in SRT file format. [3]
  <li>Edit the SRT file to correct ASR errors and re-upload to the video. This allows viewers to retain 
    the option of removing captions if they do not want to see them.
  <li>If you prefer to embed time-aligned captions into the video file itself, use the open source tool 
    HandBrake to do so. [4] This will create a self-contained MP4 file without the need for a separate 
    SRT file.
  </ul>
